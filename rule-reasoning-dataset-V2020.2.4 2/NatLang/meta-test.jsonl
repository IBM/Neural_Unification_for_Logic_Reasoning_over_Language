A person who is blue, red and nice is usually considered to be a young person. Tom is a rough, young person to know, he is very green at his job but he is very round from his weight. Young people that are relatively nice and kind to others, can also tend to be rough. People who are young are also blue. A person who is green, blue, and red in color will be round shaped.

Red people are almost always rough. If a kind person is green and a bit blue then they are also nice. Big, young people with green color are rather rough. Most young kind people tend to be red too. Red people, who are also round and young, are often quite blue as well. A kind person will certainly be young. A person who inherits genes that make them big and green will also express a blue color.","triples":{"triple1":{"text":"Alan is kind.","representation":"(\"Alan\" \"is\" \"kind\" \"+\")"},"triple2":{"text":"Alan is cold.","representation":"(\"Alan\" \"is\" \"cold\" \"+\")"},"triple3":{"text":"Bob is round.","representation":"(\"Bob\" \"is\" \"round\" \"+\")"},"triple4":{"text":"Eric is young.","representation":"(\"Eric\" \"is\" \"young\" \"+\")"},"triple5":{"text":"Eric is rough.","representation":"(\"Eric\" \"is\" \"rough\" \"+\")"},"triple6":{"text":"Eric is red.","representation":"(\"Eric\" \"is\" \"red\" \"+\")"},"triple7":{"text":"Eric is cold.","representation":"(\"Eric\" \"is\" \"cold\" \"+\")"},"triple8":{"text":"Harry is green.","representation":"(\"Harry\" \"is\" \"green\" \"+\")"},"triple9":{"text":"Harry is cold.","representation":"(\"Harry\" \"is\" \"cold\" \"+\")"},"triple10":{"text":"Harry is blue.","representation":"(\"Harry\" \"is\" \"blue\" \"+\")"}},"rules":{"rule1":{"text":"If someone is red then they are rough.","representation":"(((\"someone\" \"is\" \"red\" \"+\")) -> (\"someone\" \"is\" \"rough\" \"+\"))"},"rule2":{"text":"If someone is green and kind and blue then they are nice.","representation":"(((\"someone\" \"is\" \"green\" \"+\") (\"someone\" \"is\" \"kind\" \"+\") (\"someone\" \"is\" \"blue\" \"+\")) -> (\"someone\" \"is\" \"nice\" \"+\"))"},"rule3":{"text":"If someone is big and young and green then they are rough.","representation":"(((\"someone\" \"is\" \"big\" \"+\") (\"someone\" \"is\" \"young\" \"+\") (\"someone\" \"is\" \"green\" \"+\")) -> (\"someone\" \"is\" \"rough\" \"+\"))"},"rule4":{"text":"If someone is young and kind then they are red.","representation":"(((\"someone\" \"is\" \"young\" \"+\") (\"someone\" \"is\" \"kind\" \"+\")) -> (\"someone\" \"is\" \"red\" \"+\"))"},"rule5":{"text":"If someone is red and round and young then they are blue.","representation":"(((\"someone\" \"is\" \"red\" \"+\") (\"someone\" \"is\" \"round\" \"+\") (\"someone\" \"is\" \"young\" \"+\")) -> (\"someone\" \"is\" \"blue\" \"+\"))"},"rule6":{"text":"If someone is kind then they are young.","representation":"(((\"someone\" \"is\" \"kind\" \"+\")) -> (\"someone\" \"is\" \"young\" \"+\"))"},"rule7":{"text":"If someone is big and green then they are blue.","representation":"(((\"someone\" \"is\" \"big\" \"+\") (\"someone\" \"is\" \"green\" \"+\")) -> (\"someone\" \"is\" \"blue\" \"+\"))"}},"questions":{"Q1":{"question":"Alan is cold.","answer":true,"QDep":0,"QLen":1,"strategy":"proof","proofs":"[(triple2)]","representation":"(\"Alan\" \"is\" \"cold\" \"+\")"},"Q2":{"question":"Alan is not kind.","answer":false,"QDep":0,"QLen":1,"strategy":"inv-proof","proofs":"[(triple1)]","representation":"(\"Alan\" \"is\" \"kind\" \"-\")"},"Q3":{"question":"Alan is young.","answer":true,"QDep":1,"QLen":2,"strategy":"proof","proofs":"[(((triple1) -> rule6))]","representation":"(\"Alan\" \"is\" \"young\" \"+\")"},"Q4":{"question":"Alan is not young.","answer":false,"QDep":1,"QLen":2,"strategy":"inv-proof","proofs":"[(((triple1) -> rule6))]","representation":"(\"Alan\" \"is\" \"young\" \"-\")"},"Q5":{"question":"Alan is red.","answer":true,"QDep":2,"QLen":4,"strategy":"proof","proofs":"[(((((triple1) -> rule6) triple1) -> rule4))]","representation":"(\"Alan\" \"is\" \"red\" \"+\")"},"Q6":{"question":"Alan is not red.","answer":false,"QDep":2,"QLen":4,"strategy":"inv-proof","proofs":"[(((((triple1) -> rule6) triple1) -> rule4))]","representation":"(\"Alan\" \"is\" \"red\" \"-\")"},"Q7":{"question":"Alan is rough.","answer":true,"QDep":3,"QLen":5,"strategy":"proof","proofs":"[(((((((triple1) -> rule6) triple1) -> rule4)) -> rule1))]","representation":"(\"Alan\" \"is\" \"rough\" \"+\")"},"Q8":{"question":"Alan is not rough.","answer":false,"QDep":3,"QLen":5,"strategy":"inv-proof","proofs":"[(((((((triple1) -> rule6) triple1) -> rule4)) -> rule1))]","representation":"(\"Alan\" \"is\" \"rough\" \"-\")"},"Q9":{"question":"Alan is not blue.","answer":true,"QDep":1,"QLen":"","strategy":"inv-rconc","proofs":"[@1: Alan is blue.[CWA.
